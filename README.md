### Measuring the quality of NFT creators and NFT artworks
__________________________________________________
**Component-1: A comprehensive creator dashboard or a public creator profile page. **

>> Creators can be incentivized to fill out the details, e.g., prior experience, twitter account, preferred genre, types of tool used


>> System also provides public data: the number of followers, types of post, communication history  on social media (because i.e. Twitter media is connect)

>>  Machine learning model is utilized to visualize those info in dashboard


# Impact
>> With such a public profiling system, new NFT creators can look for which NFT art categories are in trend. They can learn about tools and can communicate for potential collaborations. 
 
>>Investment companies can have more information for trading. Facilitate trust and reduce ambiguity

**Component-2: Visual hashing with state of art computer vision to compute visual similarity of two NFTs**

>> This system is developed by existing computer vision techniques to automatically compute visual similarity of two NFTs to provide two results if the art is
Duplicate art from other account/ID at OpenSea and the level of confidence of this result


# Impact
>> When visual hashing detects highly similar NFTs, it can alert community members
